## About the Project
This repository contains my final project for the class CMPINF 1205: Comparative Digital Privacies at the University of Pittsburgh. The project is an analysis of a set of 115 website privacy policies put together by [The Usable Privacy Policy Project](https://usableprivacy.org/) to show that current privacy policies tend to benefit companies rather than the everyday people they are meant for. On the user side, I aimed for three metrics: length, legalese, and reading grade level.
